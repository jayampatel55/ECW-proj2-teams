# ECW-proj2-teams
This project is made for my internship company, it mainly provides a dynamic OneOnOne teams message sending using a click of button.
This project works as follows:
1. Onclick of the button, a popup opens.
2. Popup asks for 2 input fields, 1st, org emailID, 2nd notes(optional)
3. Then Onclick to proceed, the message is sent to the respective emails provided(OneOnOne).
Every data is possibly made dynamic according company requirements.
